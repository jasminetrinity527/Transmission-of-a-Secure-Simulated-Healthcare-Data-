# Transmission-of-a-Secure-Simulated-Healthcare-Data-
I was instructed to develop a model to simulate IoT devices, using Python ins Pycharm , which will simulate the transmission of a secure simulated health care data.This project was created as a guide to be able to understand IoT device data in real time, and encryption. This program uses safe encryption to secure data. Although, there is part of the code that shows decryption as an example of what the results would look like if the information was in a decrypted state. I used example blood pressure readings, but if I would want to make this code reading more realistic I can put my own blood pressure readings inside of the source code.
